This is the Report Website for my Group Project in CPU Scheduling Stimulator. 

To run the website, install the react-mdl first in command line, then install React Router DOM.

Deployed the site on Heroku https://tmd-report-website.herokuapp.com/

The source codes for C program are taken from https://github.com/tandduong/cpu-scheduling-tmd
